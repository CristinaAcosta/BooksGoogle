# BooksGoogle

Repo: https://github.com/CristinaAcosta/BooksGoogle
Deploy: https://cristinagooglebook.herokuapp.com/

## Description:

Here I created a site where a user can find books based on a title through Google API. The user is able to look at the title, author, description, image, and a link to the book in Google. The user is then able to save the book to be displayed on the save page and then delete the book.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- Bootstrap
- Express
- MongoDB

## Things we learned:

- I had a hard time with linking the backend and the front end together. The delete function is also still not working due to a depreciation error. I also keep having challenges with deploying my app with Heroku.
